# Golden Sun: TLA PopTracker

Tracker pack for [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/) with Autotracking.

PopTracker v0.29.0 or higher is recommended

## Installation

Download Poptracker from the link above, and place installation anywhere on your PC. Place this pack inside the "Packs" folder within.

## To Use
Open Poptracker, click the Folder Icon in the top left corner, and select the "Golden Sun: TLA PopTracker."


## Autotracking

Click the gray "AP" icon at the top. Enter your server address (if hosted on the AP website, this will be archipelago.gg:xxxxx, where xxxxx = your room's port.) Then, enter your slot name, and password (if no password, leave blank.) The "AP" icon should turn green, this means you're good to go!

## Notes

Currently Djinns and Events (Items under Progression) are not supported by the apworld to get tracked automatically, so these will need to be done manually for now.
When shuffling every location, open the settings menu to the left of the "AP" icon and change "Mode" to "All items" to enable showing the additional locations.
Locations on Superbosses and Anemos Sanctum will currently always show, even when omitted by the settings.
